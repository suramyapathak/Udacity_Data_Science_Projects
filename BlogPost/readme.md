### Project Motivation

As per Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project to write a Data science blogpost I use the Stack Overflow 2020 Survey data.
for more information refer to the medium blogpost for this project:https://medium.com/@suramya.pathak/how-to-unstuck-at-the-job-ff9da36d510a

###Summary of the Project
The project reviewed the Stack Overflow Survey Data 2020. We look through the data and try to visualize the current scenario.

We start with parameters like Country-wise Job Satisfaction. Then, look for the pattern in Education with Compensation level and then we move forward to current technologies/languages in use and the desired technologies/languages people like to work with.

Since we want to analyze the data from people who codes for first two sections, we limit ourselves to the data filled by the develeopers only.

For the third section, to understand the industries' needs, we analyze the data about current and future trends in languages/technologies, we gather the data from all the respondents across all the countries so that the viewpoint of the people who are non coders but are vital to the industies for example, VP of a company can also be included.
