## Project Motivation

As per Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project Starbucks Project, the project uses data from Starbucks app is a simulation of the customer behaviour on the Starbucks rewards mobile app.

###Summary of the Project

The project gives a opportunity to work on real world problem, a data set containing articles and user preferences of the article. This project aims to yield an operational result through the conglomeration of the data set. The challenge is to arrive at a conclusive remark by examining data from diverse facets. Here, an enlarged number of offer engagement is the ultimate destination we hope to arrive at. Additionally, there is a demographic which will make a purchase irrespective of whether the offer is presented. I make an effort to pursue this data to minimize the loss due to uninvited offers. This study involves a three-part investigation design which will hopefully direct us towards favourable projections.
