# Project: Disaster Response Pipeline
### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/

Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

## Project Motivation

As per Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project Disaster Response Pipeline Project, the project uses data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API to classify disaster messages.

###Summary of the Project

The project gives a opportunity to work on real world problem, a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events, we created a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.
